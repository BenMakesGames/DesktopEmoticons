# DesktopEmoticons

Runs in your system tray. Right or left click to pull up a menu of categorized emoticons. Click on an emoticon to immediately copy it to your clipboard ヾ（＾ヮ＾)ﾉ

It's easy to code in your own emoticons (assuming you have Visual Studio). Look near the top of Program.cs to see how the emoticons are added.

I realize I could have gone one step further and had this program read the emoticons from some kind of external text file or something, but... ¯\\\_(°⊱,°)_/¯

As the creator of this code, I am releasing whatever few copyright claims I may have over this code to the public domain. Any of the "tricky" bits in here were probably taken from MSDN documentation or Stack Overflow, anyway. Other than that, I wrote a class, and a function that turns a Dictionary into some MenuItems... so... whatever; don't care; public domain'd! Code is provided as-is, without warranty of any kind, etc!

Enjoy! *:ﾟ*｡⋆ฺ(*´◡`)
